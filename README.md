## Problem Statement

Hi Jorge,
Question for todayâ€™s exercise :
Description (For backend candidates)
Your assignment is to create a microservice which serves the contents of photographers.json through a REST API.
The service should expose three REST endpoints:

- GET /api/photographers - returns the list of all photographers.
- GET /api/photographers/{photographerID} - returns a single photographer by ID.
- GET /api/photographers/event/{eventType} - returns a list of photographers for the specified event type.

  Examples of event_types:

- wedding
- birthdays
- wildlife
- sports

  The above APIs should only return high-level characteristics of the photographer data. For example - name, contact,
  avatar, event_types etc.
  Please create unit tests that cover the core logic.
  With time permitting, package the application for distribution. Some examples of this:
  Docker image (preferred)
  Tomcat WAR
  Static binary

Preparation Instructions to be Shared in Advance
You are free to choose whatever programming language you are comfortable with, SDKs, web frameworks, databases, and
online resources to complete this exercise.
